# Steps to Run the Project

## Application Development & Testing

**Test Before Deploy:** Always test your application locally before proceeding to containerization and deployment.

**Containerization with Docker:**
- Create Dockerfiles for both **Frontend** and **Backend** components with their required dependencies
- Use **Docker Compose** to orchestrate multiple containers (Frontend, Backend, MongoDB) seamlessly
- Single-command deployment for local development:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## AWS Infrastructure Provisioning

### Prerequisites
- Configure AWS access keys to grant Terraform permissions to your AWS account
- Complete the `terraform.tfvars` file with your variable definitions

### Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
terraform apply --auto-approve
```
> **Note:** The script outputs the EC2 instance's Public IP address for subsequent configuration steps.

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

### Prerequisites - GitHub Secrets Setup
Configure the following in your GitHub repository secrets:
- **Public IP** (from Terraform output)
- **Host name** (ubuntu for Ubuntu instances)
- **Private key** (paired with EC2's public key)

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Trigger:** Code pushes to the main branch
- **Process:** Checkout code â†’ Run application tests
- **Output:** Test coverage stored in `.lcov` file

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **Purpose:** Automated application deployment to production
- **Method:** Uses appleboy SSH action to connect to EC2 instance
- **Deployment:** Executes bash script running `docker-compose` for app deployment

## Security & Configuration Notes

### Security Best Practices
- Keep sensitive files private and out of public repositories
- Use environment variables for secrets and configuration

### Frontend Configuration
> **Critical:** Update frontend API URLs from `localhost` to the actual server's public IP address. This ensures proper communication between frontend and backend in production environment.

This streamlined process takes your application from development to production with automated testing and deployment, leveraging containerization and infrastructure as code for consistency and reliability.
